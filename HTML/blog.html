            </p>
              <h3>Positive Impacts:
            </h3>
            <h4>1.Advanced Business and Marketing</h4>
           <p> With the ongoing modernization we are mostly seen spending more time on electronics like cell phones, tablets and laptops.

            </p>
           <h4>2. Advanced Travelling and Transportation Facility</h4>
           <p>
           Growth in advancement of technology is also seen in the transportation field. Before we needed to go to the required office for booking tickets. Now it’s been more convenient that we can purchase tickets via our devices using websites like SeatGuru.
           </p>
           <h4>3. Distance Education and Modern Learning</h4>
           <p>Technology saved us from many problems that we suffered on a regular basis. After the breakdown of covid-19 ,lockdown was implemented everywhere , people were maintaining social distancing but e-learning platforms like zoom, google classroom etc helped us to stay connected and continue our education without any issues.
           </p> 
           <h4>4. Secured Bill Payment</h4>
           <p>
           Technology really made our life a piece of heaven to live in. From waking up to the end of the day, we relied on machinery to get our work done. By incorporating digital wallets by locals like mobile wallets, QR payments made transactions more convenient and safer and maintained the relationship between customers and the dealers.
            </p>
           <h4>5. Easy Accessibility to Information</h4>
            <p>

            </p> 
            <h3> Negative Impacts</h3>  
            <p>
                Everything that has a positive impact comes with some negativity too. Technology really upholds the most part of our lives but makes us more dependent on them. There are a lot of negative impacts of technology. With the advancement in use of digital platforms there is a high risk that our privacy is hampered.Nowadays we can hear different news about how people's accounts being hacked.Technology made our life comfortable and it's easy to find the solution of each and every problem with one click on internet which make us more dependent and mentally dull.one of the major issues that people are being victim of is online fraud. Several fake sites are being promoted on social media accusing large groups of people of money or stealing their personal information.Nowadays we can see that without any devices on hand it's impossible to feed kids . Sudden outbreak of the pandemic compelled us to stay in our home for a long time which made kids more focused on their electronics rather than studies. Mobile games like pubg, ML, free fire etc are diverting their mind from any sorts of recreational activities whereas they are having less quality time with family members.People are attracted towards online shopping which saves their time somehow but local stores present there are on the verge of closing.   
                <br>  Even in the photography area too, technology contributed a lot. Digital camera stands among other cameras in many ways. It is cost effective ,is a video camera,editing can be done easily without any issue,performs multiple operations, whereas the photos can be shared easily.Lastly, technology plays a huge importance in our day-to-day life. From the start of the day to the end of the day somehow, we are dependent on technology. We should learn to use technology in the proper manner so that it won't impact our life negatively. If we use it in a proper way then obviously it would bless us with enormous comfort and luxury.
